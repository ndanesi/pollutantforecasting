Code used in the thesis 'Short term forecasting of atmospheric air pollutants using Long Short-Term Memory'
The code was developed by Nicholas Danesi and Mayank Jain. Inside each of the files, there are instructions on downloading the data and running it; if you require more help, please email me at nick.danesi@ucdconnect.ie

The code is split into three files:
1. The webscraper
2. The Holt Winters triple exponential smoothing model predictor
3. The Long Short-term memory model predictor
